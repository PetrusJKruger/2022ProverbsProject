## Proverbs 1: 1-33

<sup>1</sup>
The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:

<sup>2</sup>
for gaining wisdom and instruction, for understanding words of insight;

<sup>3</sup>
for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair;

<sup>4</sup>
for giving prudence to those who are simple, knowledge and discretion to the young - 

<sup>5</sup>
let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance - 

<sup>6</sup>
for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.

<sup>7</sup>
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 

<sup>8</sup>
Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.

<sup>9</sup>
They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.

<sup>10</sup>
My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them.
