## Proverbs 1: 1-33

<sup>1</sup>
The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel

<sup>2</sup>
for gaining wisdom and instruction, for understanding words of insight;

<sup>3</sup>
for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair;

<sup>4</sup>
for giving prudence to those who are simple, knowledge and discretion to the young - 

<sup>5</sup>
let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance - 

<sup>6</sup>
for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.

<sup>7</sup>
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 

<sup>8</sup>
Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.

<sup>9</sup>
They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.

<sup>10</sup>
My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them.

<sup>11</sup>
If they say, "Come along with us;
let's lie in wait for innocent blood,
let's ambush some harmless soul;

<sup>12</sup>
let's swallow them alive, like the grave,
and whole, like those who go down to the pit;

<sup>13</sup>
we will find all sorts of valuable things 
and fill our houses with plunder;

<sup>14</sup>
cast lots with us,
we will all share in the loot" - 

<sup>15</sup>
my son, do not go along with them, 
do not set foot on their paths;

<sup>16</sup>
for their feet rush into evil,
they are swift to shed blood.

<sup>17</sup>
How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds!

<sup>18</sup>
These men lie in wait for their own blood;
they ambush only themselves!

<sup>19</sup>
Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain;
it takes away the life of those who get it.

<sup>20</sup>
Out in the open wisdom calls out,
she raises her voice in the public square;

<sup>21</sup>
on top of the wall she cries out,
at the gates leading into the city, she makes her speech:

<sup>22</sup>
"How long will you simple ones love your simple ways?
how long will mockers delight in mockery
and fools hate knowledge?

<sup>23</sup>
Repent at my rebuke!
The I will pour out my heart to you,
I will make known to you my teachings.

<sup>24</sup>
But since you refuse to listen when I call,
and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,

<sup>25</sup>
since you ignore all my advice
and do not accept my rebuke,

<sup>26</sup>
I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you;
I will mock when calamity overtakes you - 

<sup>27</sup>
when calamity overtakes you like a storm, 
when disaster washes over you like a whirlwind, 
when distress and trouble overwhelm you. 

<sup>28</sup>
"Then they will call to me but I will not answer,
they will look for me but will not find me, 

<sup>29</sup>
Since they hated knowledge
and did not choose to fear the LORD.

<sup>30</sup>
Since they would not accept my advice 
and spurned my rebuke, 

<sup>31</sup>
The will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes

<sup>32</sup>
For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, 
and the complacency of fools will destrou them;

<sup>33</sup>
but whoever listens to me will live in safety
and be at ease, without fear of harm."
