## Proverbs 1: 1-33

<sup>1</sup>
The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel

<sup>2</sup>
for gaining wisdom and instruction, for understanding words of insight;

<sup>3</sup>
for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair;

<sup>4</sup>
for giving prudence to those who are simple, knowledge and discretion to the young - 

<sup>5</sup>
let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance - 

<sup>6</sup>
for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.

<sup>7</sup>
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 

<sup>8</sup>
Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.

<sup>9</sup>
They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.

<sup>10</sup>
My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them.

<sup>11</sup>
If they say, "Come along with us;
let's lie in wait for innocent blood,
let's ambush some harmless soul;

<sup>12</sup>
let's swallow them alive, like the grave,
and whole, like those who go down to the pit;

<sup>13</sup>
we will find all sorts of valuable things 
and fill our houses with plunder;

<sup>14</sup>
cast lots with us,
we will all share in the loot" - 

<sup>15</sup>
my son, do not go along with them, 
do not set foot on their paths;

<sup>16</sup>
for their feet rush into evil,
they are swift to shed blood.

<sup>17</sup>
How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds!

<sup>18</sup>
These men lie in wait for their own blood;
they ambush only themselves!

<sup>19</sup>
Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain;
it takes away the life of those who get it.
