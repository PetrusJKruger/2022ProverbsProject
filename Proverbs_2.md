<sup>1</sup>
My son, if you accept my words
and store up my commands within you, 

<sup>2</sup>
turning your ear to wisdom, 
and applying your heart to understanding - 

<sup>3</sup>
indeed, if you call out for insight 
and cry aloud for understanding

<sup>4</sup>
and if you look for it as for silver
and search for it as for hidden treasure,

<sup>5</sup>
then you will understand the fear of the LORD,
and find the knowledge of God.

<sup>6</sup>
For the LORD gives wisdom; 
from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.

<sup>6</sup>
He holds success in store for the upright,
he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,

<sup>7</sup>
for he guards the course of the just
and protects the way of his faithful ones.

<sup>8</sup>
Then you will understand what is right and just and fair - 
every good path.

<sup>9</sup>
For wisdom will enter you heart,
and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.

<sup>10</sup>
Discretion will protect you
and undestanding will guard you.

<sup>11</sup>
Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men,
from men whose words are perverse, 

<sup>12</sup>
who have left the straight paths to walk in dark ways,

<sup>13</sup>
who delight in doing wrong
and rejoice in the perverseness of evil, 

<sup>14</sup>
whose paths are crooked
and who are devious in their ways. 

<sup>15</sup>
Wisdom will save you also from the adultress,
from the wayward woman with her seductive words, 

<sup>16</sup>
who has left the partner of her youth
and ignored the covenant she made before God.

<sup>17</sup>
Surely her house leads down to death
and her paths to the spirits of the dead.

<sup>18</sup>
None who go to her return
or attain the paths of life.

<sup>19</sup>
Thus you will walk in the ways of good men
and keep to the paths of the righteous.

<sup>20</sup>
For the upright will live in the land, 
and the blameless will remain in it;

<sup>21</sup>
but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
and the unfaithful will be torn from it.
