<sup>1</sup>
My son, if you accept my words
and store up my commands within you, 

<sup>2</sup>
turning your ear to wisdom, 
and applying your heart to understanding - 

<sup>3</sup>
indeed, if you call out for insight 
and cry aloud for understanding

<sup>4</sup>
and if you look for it as for silver
and search for it as for hidden treasure,

<sup>5</sup>
then you will understand the fear of the LORD,
and find the knowledge of God.

<sup>6</sup>
For the LORD gives wisdom; 
from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.

<sup>6</sup>
He holds success in store for the upright,
he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,

<sup>7</sup>
for he guards the course of the just
and protects the way of his faithful ones.
