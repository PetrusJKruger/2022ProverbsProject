My son, do not forget my teaching, 
but keep my commands in your heart, 

<sup>2</sup>
for they will prolong your life many years
and bring you peace and prosperity.

<sup>3</sup>
Let love and faithfulness never leave you;
bind them around your neck,
write them on the tablet of your heart.

<sup>4</sup>
Then you will favor and a good name
in the sight of God and man.

<sup>5</sup>
Trust in the LORD with all your heart
and lean not on your own understanding;

<sup>6</sup>
in all your ways acknowledge Him, 
and He will make your paths straight.
