My son, do not forget my teaching, 
but keep my commands in your heart, 

<sup>2</sup>
for they will prolong your life many years
and bring you peace and prosperity.

<sup>3</sup>
Let love and faithfulness never leave you;
bind them around your neck,
write them on the tablet of your heart.

<sup>4</sup>
Then you will favor and a good name
in the sight of God and man.

<sup>5</sup>
Trust in the LORD with all your heart
and lean not on your own understanding;

<sup>6</sup>
in all your ways acknowledge Him, 
and He will make your paths straight. 

<sup>7</sup>
Do not be wise in your own eyes;
fear the LORD and shun evil.

<sup>8</sup>
This will bring health to your body
and nourishment to your bones.

<sup>9</sup>
Honor the LORD with your wealth,
with the firstfruits of all your crops;

<sup>10</sup>
then your barns will be filled to overflowing,
and your vats will brim over with new wine. 

<sup>11</sup>
My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline, 
and do not resent his rebuke,

<sup>12</sup>
because the LORD disciplines those he loves,
as a father the son he delights in.

<sup>13</sup>
Blessed are those who find wisdom,
those who gain understanding,

<sup>14</sup>
for she is more profitable than silver
and yields better returns than gold.

<sup>15</sup>
She is more precious than rubies; 
nothing you desire can compare with her.

<sup>16</sup>
Long life is in her right hand;
in her left hand are riches and honor.

<sup>17</sup>
Her ways are pleasant ways, 
and all her paths are peace.

<sup>18</sup>
She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her;
those who hold her fast will be blessed.
